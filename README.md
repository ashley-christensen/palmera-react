Creation: 

Features: Formik, react-select/DatePicker, Leaflet Maps Library. Combination of both functional and class based components, passing state as props and updating state/computing state through parent component using new libraries. 

Learning: I learned State Flow, Hooks, and implemented conditional rendering depending on the state of a Promise returned. I used Leaflet Map library and inserted popups populated with data returned from a promise. I modularized my project by using multiple components per page while populating each component with data computed depending on user input.
